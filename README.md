I am following the "Fullstack React GraphQL TypeScript Tutorial" from Ben Awad on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/I6ypD7qv3Z8). I figured this would be a long tutorial so I want to add my own spin to it. It's called Club Jan after one of my favourite web games as a kid, Club Penguin. While this is not a web game, I intend to follow the videos' tutorial to create a 'Reddit Clone' but with my own twist.
