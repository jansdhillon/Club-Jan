I want to practice using new JavaScript library so I am starting this porject. I was a big fan of Club Penguin when I was a kid and I know it was made using Flash, so I want to make a similar game using JavaScript. I'm also interested in learning more about things like WebGPU that can allow me to use the GPU to render graphics.
